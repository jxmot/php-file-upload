Notes and demonstration code for uploading files using PHP

# History

I had been looking for a way to upload files via my browser to my website. I could have used SFTP but this was to be part of a larger application. And that application required a means to upload files.

After reading and researching I came accross a tutorial (<https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/php-tutorial/php-file-upload.php>) that showed me what I needed to get started.

The code found in the *root* of this repository is my **modified** version of the original tutorial code. The original code can be found in the `/orig` folder in this repo.
